# Controllable TalkNet 
Controllable TalkNet is a web application that lets you synthesize speech, 
which mimics the pitch and pacing of an existing audio clip. It's based on [NVIDIA's implementation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo)
of TalkNet 2, with some changes to support singing synthesis and higher audio quality.

## Requirements
